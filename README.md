The rapid spread of blogs, social networking sites, and media-sharing technology (such as Youtube, and Facebook), aided by the proliferation of mobile technology. Knowing the pain point, we are developing a social network application where people can join in sharing memories, easily communicate, and update the newest news wherever life is changing around us.
  Hit first sight, the homepage represents the functionalities of the memories website. We are on the trait to developing the website's full functionalities including sharing posts, updating the newest daily life, chatting and making small societies into a website. Inspired by Facebook, Linkedln, and many former do, we cover the best experience from those and make our own.
